	Dwarves are stout and sturdy people born of focus and industry. <br>\

The stocky strength and natural bulk of a Dwarf is only matched by their single-minded focus, which is often mistaken for stubbornness.\ In truth Dwarves are outgoing and playful people fond of drink and roughhousing when there isnâ€™t work on the line.\ In times of trouble you can always count on a dwarf to put their life on the line to aid their kin and comrades. <br>\

The greatest empire of the Radiant Age was built with dwarven stone. Dwarves are deeply proud of that fact. <br>\

Dwarven history is as much a series of brilliant buildings, crafts and contraptions as it is a legacy of kings, clans and honour. To a Dwarf a skill is to always be mastered.\
If a job is to be done it must be done right. This has led Dwarves to being not only great craftsmen but the upper echelon of many careers be it labourers, merchants, warriors or scholars.<br>\
