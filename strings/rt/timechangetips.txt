The Wheel turns the Axle.
Yours is a fate few share.
Time shifts; even where it will never set.
...Was standing in a clearing. There were snowflakes all around...
Know well that you step on hallowed ground.
Sun's grasp upon all.
Wonder now the gifts of life.
Towers, Walls and Doors...
It is the year %currenticyear%, of the Dawn Era - and all's well.
Rasura protects.
Rumor berests Sunmarch. It's only what we thrive within.
The 'Light Pantheon' contains only Aeternus, the sun god who sequestered the world into the Dawn Era's grasp. Aeternian followers oft have to deal with the other Pantheon's... eccentricities between each other.
The 'Order Pantheon' is helmed by Zira, the goddess of the moon and Aeternus' shadow. They broadly preach for organization; for readiness and rigor in a world that could one day need it's structure the end of the Dawn Era.
The 'Chaos Pantheon' is helmed by Cinella, the goddess of the seas and Zira's mirror. They broadly preach for discovery, wide-cast and free-reign in a world that could one day need it's innovations at the end of the Dawn Era.
