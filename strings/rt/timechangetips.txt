The Wheel turns the Axle.
Yours is a fate few share.
Time shifts; even where it will never set.
...Was standing in a clearing. There were snowflakes all around...
Know well that you step on hallowed ground.
Sun's grasp upon all.
Wonder now the gifts of life.
Towers, Walls and Doors...
It is the year %currenticyear%, of the Dawn Era - and all's well.
Rasura protects.
Rumor berests Sunmarch. It's only what we thrive within.
