My ears burn in it all.
They want me dead... don't they?
It all flashed in blue... didn't it?
I am hit in the head with a bolt! Blood sprays from my head!
Something in my back hurts.
Something in my chest hurts.
Something in my head hurts.
Something in my back hurts.
Something in my chest hurts.
Something in my head hurts.
Adrenaline surge. My chest hurts. My breath quickens.
I'm so tired.
The Wheel... The Axle.
A fate few share... oh; so terrible.
My heart sears in fire unseen.
The world itself conspires to fold upon me.
You feel a tiny prick.
Shadows dance on the edge of your vision.
