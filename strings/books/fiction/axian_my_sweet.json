Penned by Ostent M; Proud and Tall. Sun's Grasp of Ail's Ease, 79DE. Penned in honor of my husband, Rhet.
<br><br>

I saw you in the markets, fresh from the seas.<br>
'Offloading wares', you said - met with astare.<br>
Murmur struck street, murmur struck heart.<br>
I saw your hair, dressed in the colors of Cinella's deep.<br>
I saw your strength; as the chest's worth hit the cobble beneath.<br>
I saw your smile; pointed as the exchange progressed, and I...<br>
I knew of your freedoms, your wide berths on our shores. I knew that left unsaid;<br>
you would return to her grasp in time's flow - when all I wanted was for you, here,<br>
to hold my hands upon sunset shore. I knew in moment I had to speak; I had to raise.<br>
I raced towards you, stumbling over myself every step.<br>
I felt the weight on my shoulders lift; the air part.<br>
I felt the rocks twist - and weight slip.<br>
Directly afront, I laid, scene well created and laughs around.
<br><br>

Yet, I spoke. I spoke the only words I could remember.
Axian, my sweet...<br>
Please, oh. Be mine."]}
