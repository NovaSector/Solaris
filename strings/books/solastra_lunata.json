<h2>Overture</h2>

1:1 - Echoes ripped through the seas of nothing, raindrops upon essence itself. There; amongst all, were those who cared most.
Aeternus, who's flame beat back the void in silent breaths - and Zira; who wrought color upon that which did not have it. Both
stood now in audience of a collapsing world; a void beyond voids; and both thought well to renew.

1:2 - It was Aeternus' hand that gifted the world it's maths; just as Zira's hand wrought the elements. His that founded the
seas; hers that founded the rivers. As he had brought light to it's new dawn - so to had she brought darkness upon it's dusk.
They moved in tandem; though far from one - as the world run itself anew."]}
