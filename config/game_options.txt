## MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variables ingame to find a good speed for your server.
## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.
## Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals ingame.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied.
RUN_DELAY 2
WALK_DELAY 3

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types. THIS AFFECTS ALL SUBTYPES OF THE TYPE YOU CHOOSE!
## Entries completely override all subtypes. Later entries have precedence over earlier entries.
## This means if you put /mob 0 on the last entry, it will null out all changes, while if you put /mob as the first entry and
## /mob/living/carbon/human on the last entry, the last entry will override the first.
##MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/human 0
##MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/silicon/robot 0
##MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/monkey 0

## Toggles for continuous modes.
## Modes that aren't continuous will end the instant all antagonists are dead.

## Uncomment these for overrides of the minimum / maximum number of players in a round type.
## If you set any of these occasionally check to see if you still need them as the modes
## will still be actively rebalanced around the SUGGESTED populations, not your overrides.
## Notes: For maximum number of players a value of -1 means no maximum. Setting minimums to
## VERY low numbers (< 5) can lead to errors if the roundtypes were not designed for that.

MINIMAL_ACCESS_THRESHOLD 20

## Comment this out this if you wish to use the setup where jobs have more access.
## This is intended for servers with low populations - where there are not enough

## Can be any number above 4, some examples are provided below.

## Small (3, 7, 14)
